### What is NodeJS? 
Node.JS is a JavaScript runtime built on google's open source v8 Javascript engine.

JavaScript is a programming language, which runs in web browsers. Whereas Node.js is an interpreter or running environment for JavaScript, which holds a lot of requiring libraries and all. JavaScript is basically one standard defining programming language; it can run any browser with a default browser running environment. It is a very strong language normally used for a web application on any verification or any specific business logic. We need to append in the screen without page refreshing. JavaScript also helps to use Ajax at any time, which helps us call any server-side script for given dynamic data based on the requirement. It also helps with generating dynamic HTML tables based on business requirement. JQuery is one of the popular libraries to make comfortable use of JavaScript by avoiding to write a lot of code.

Key Differences Between JavaScript vs Node JS

1. JavaScript is a simple programming language that runs in any browser JavaScript Engine. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or running environment for a JavaScript programming language that holds many excesses, it requires libraries that can easily be accessed from JavaScript programming for better use.

2. JavaScript is normally used for any client-side activity for one web application. An activity can be addressing business validation or dynamic page display in some schedule time interval or basic Ajax call kind of task. Those are used for a maximum time for any web application. Whereas Node JS mainly used for accessing or running any operating system for non-blocking operation. An operation like creating or executing a shell script, or getting some specific hardware-related information on one call or installed certificate details in the system or a lot of define task is non-blocking on an operating system.

3. JavaScript running in any engine like Spider monkey (FireFox), JavaScript Core (Safari), V8 (Google Chrome). So JavaScript programming is very easy to write, and put any running environment means proper browser. Whereas Node JS only support the V8 engine, which googles chrome specific. But whether it supports the V8 engine, written JavaScript code can able to run in any environment. So there has no browser-specific constraint on it.

4. JavaScript is normally following Java Programming language standard. There may have some different way of writing code, but at the same time, we can say it following the Java Programming language standard. Whereas node JS is written in C++ and provides a V8 engine base browser javascript running engine, it helps us run a written javascript program in any browser environment.

5. For accessing any operating system, specific non-blocking task JavaScript has some specific object, but all of them are operating system specific. An example is ActiveX Control which is only running in Windows. But Node JS is given utility to run some operating system specific non-blocking tasks from any JavaScript programming. It doesnâ€™t have any operating system specific constant. Node JS is very much familiar to create a specific binding with the file system and allows the developer to read or sometimes write on disk.
